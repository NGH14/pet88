# Welcome to Pet88 Storybook!

Storybook helps Pet88 build UI components in isolation from Pet88 business logic, data, and context. That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar. View their code in the src/stories directory to learn how they work. We recommend building UIs with a component-driven process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
